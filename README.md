## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express

### 1. Front-end Development (HTML/CSS, EJS, JavaScript)
-  **HTML/CSS:** The user interface (UI) of the application is designed using HTML for the structure and CSS for styling. It defines the layout, buttons, forms, and other visual elements that users interact with.
- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript):** EJS is a templating engine for JavaScript that embeds dynamic content in HTML. In Breakout, EJS is used to generate dynamic web pages, enabling the application to display personalized content based on the data fetched from the back-end.
- **JavaScript:** The front-end functionality is implemented using JavaScript. It provides the interactivity and dynamic behavior to the app, making it responsive to user actions, handling form submissions, and facilitating smooth user experiences.

### 2. Back-end Development (JavaScript, Node, Express)
- **Node.js:** Node.js is a powerful runtime environment that allows running JavaScript on the server-side. In Breakout, Node.js is used as the server-side runtime, enabling efficient handling of various operations such as data processing, database interactions, and server-side business logic.

- **Express.js:** Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, providing a set of tools and features to build robust web applications. It simplifies routing, middleware implementation, and request handling. In EventMaster, Express.js is the backbone of the server-side architecture, managing routes and handling HTTP requests and responses.

### 3. Database (MongoDB)
- **MongoDB:** MongoDB is a NoSQL database used to store the data for the application. It provides a scalable data storage solution with a flexible schema. In Breakout, MongoDB stores all the event data, including details about conferences, organizers, speakers, attendees, etc.
